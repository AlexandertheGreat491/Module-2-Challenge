# Portfolio

## Description

- What was your motivation?
  My motivation in creating this project was to make a an accessible and responsive site to showcase my work to potential employers.
- Why did you build this project?
  I built this project to showcase by work to potential employers.
- What problem does it solve?
  The problem that is solved through this project is the need for employers to be able to view a potential employee's work samples.
- What did you learn?
  I learned that it would have made building this project much easier if I had created a wireframe prior to beginning my build, because I had to restyle the page multiple times, due to a lack of planning. I learned how and when to use flexbox and media query's to make the site reponsive to changing screen sizes and I was able to build on my previous learning about using semantic HTML to make a more accessible site.
